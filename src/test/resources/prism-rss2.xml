Can either allogenic (external) or autogenic (internal) factors predict species patterns during succession?LocationPumice Plain of Mount St. Helens (46.23449°N; 122.15929°W, 1230 m a.s.l.), which was sterilized in 1980 by a direct volcanic blast, then buried in pumice.MethodsWe monitored a grid of 200 100-m2 contiguous plots annually (1989–2010) and classified the 2010 data into five community types (CTs). We characterized plots using external (e.g. distance from relict sites) and internal (e.g. moisture) factors and clustered plots by position and habitat factors to assess trajectories. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to assess relationships between vegetation and these variables over time. Mantel tests, similarity changes and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate successional trends.ResultsFive CTs were weakly related to habitats at this scale. Over time, vegetation became more homogeneous and successional trajectories of plots clustered by position and habitat factors became more similar or developed in parallel. The succession rate slowed fitfully as persistent species became dominant, while Lupinus fluctuated. Mantel tests indicated that relationships between species and environment were maximized using only autogenic factors. RDA found that autogenic factors were stronger than allogenic ones, while explained variance did not increase after 1992 and factor correlations to species stabilized by 1996.ConclusionsThe strength of links between vegetation and environment were weak at this scale, yet explained variation stabilized early in succession. As substantial vegetative variation persisted and convergence was far from complete due to weak links to habitat factors, habitat variation and stochastic establishment should be considered by vegetation managers.</description>

    <description>AimTo calibrate a model of the relationship between bio-proxies (pollen, phytoliths and δ13C of soil organic matter) and woody cover, measured as the leaf area index (LAI). This relationship, applied in palaeosequences, enables reconstruction of past savanna tree cover.LocationThe samples are from tropical Africa. Modern soil samples are from the Central African Republic and past samples are from sediments of lakes in Senegal and Congo.MethodsWe analysed the pollen and phytolith content and stable carbon isotope values of 17 soil samples taken from three short transects in the Central African Republic; LAI was measured on the same transects. The indices used were the AP/NAP ratio of arboreal (AP) to non-arboreal (NAP) pollen, the D/P ratio of ligneous dicotyledons (D) to Poaceae (P) phytoliths, and the δ13C of soil organic matter, i.e. the 13C/12C ratio.ResultsA multi-proxy model was calibrated. The best model included only a combination of pollen and phytolith as proxies, excluding organic matter δ13C because of its long mean residence time in the soil. The model was then applied to two palaeosequences in Africa, and a time series of relative LAI changes was obtained, providing new information about vegetation changes.ConclusionThis model can be applied in palaeosequences to reconstruct relative time series of LAI in African savannas and can help interpret vegetation changes quantitatively.

    <description>QuestionCould inter- and intra-specific shrub variability override abiotic stress in driving shrub-grass interactions along an altitudinal gradient?LocationEleven sites along an altitudinal gradient in the mediterranean-temperate transition of the central western Iberian Peninsula (Salamanca province, Spain).MethodsAmong study sites, different shrub species account for inter-specific variability. At each site, three patches differing in age of dominant shrubs were established to represent intra-specific variability. We established eight 25 × 25 cm sampling quadrants within and beyond the influence of shrubs, and surveyed abundance of a mesophytic perennial grass (Agrostis castellana) in each patch. As a surrogate of the balance in shrub-grass interaction, we computed RII (relative intensity of interaction).

    <description>Questions:(1) Can above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of Patagonian meadows be estimated from remote sensing? (2) How does ANPP of Patagonian meadows change in space and time?Location:Northwestern Patagonia, meadows embedded in a steppe matrix (39–43°S, 70–72ºW; area: 85 000 km2).Methods:For the first question, we contrasted field ANPP measurements with MODIS high-spatial resolution (pixel size: 0.0625 km2) data and developed a model that estimates radiation use efficiency.

    <description>Questions: (i) How do large proportions of seeds pass through the guts of goats without damage? (ii) What is the temporal pattern of seed defecation? (iii) Does ingestion by goats enhance or depress seed germination?Location: Doñana Natural Park, SW Spain.Methods: Six female goats of similar size and age were fed with 1000 seeds of four common Mediterranean shrub species (Cistus salvifolius, Halimium halimifolium, Myrtus communis, Pistacia lentiscus), which were retrieved from the goat's dung 96 h after ingestion. The seeds retrieved were tested for germination and viability, along with seeds not eaten by the goats.Results: Less than 30% of the seeds eaten were retrieved from the dung, with significant differences between species. No seeds of P. lentiscus were retrieved. The major part of the seeds was retrieved between 48 and 72 h after ingestion in all other species.

    <description>Question: Is epiphytic lichen community structure significantly affected by isolation from source community?Location: Foothills of the Southern Alps, South Island, New Zealand.Methods: Epiphytic lichen richness and environmental variables were measured on 382, young Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides (Hook. f.) Poole (mountain beech) trees that had recently colonized grassland adjacent to a forest remnant. Richness and the presence of individual lichen taxa were modelled as a function of isolation from the forest fragment, tree size and other habitat conditions.Results: Richness of epiphytic lichen communities was negatively related to tree isolation, although this effect was much smaller than the effects of tree size and other local (tree-scale) habitat conditions. Different lichen taxa responded in different ways to isolation, area effects and local habitat conditions.Conclusions: This study shows that many epiphytic lichens on mountain beech are limited in their ability to colonize new substrate, even over distances of less than 1 km, which may be due to limitation in dispersal and/or establishment. Lichens are greatly influenced by local habitat conditions, such as tree size, and in this particular environment their negative interaction with sooty moulds is an important driver of community structure.</description>

    <description>Questions: On sandy coastal habitats, factors related to substrate and to wind action vary along the sea–inland ecotone, forming a marked directional disturbance and stress gradient.

We address this issue and attempt to shed light on the role of environmental stress/disturbance gradients and propagule pressure on invasibility of plant communities in these typical model systems.Location: Sandy coasts of Lazio (Central Italy).Methods: We proposed an innovative methodology to deal with low prevalence of alien occurrence in a data set and high cost of field-based sampling by taking advantage, through predictive modelling, of the strong interrelation between vegetation and abiotic features in coastal dunes. We fitted generalized additive models to analyse (1) overall patterns of alien occurrence and spread and (2) specific patterns of the most common alien species recorded.Conclusion: Even in the presence of strong propagule pressure, variation in local abiotic conditions can explain differences in invasibility within a local environment, and intermediate levels of natural disturbance and stress offer the best conditions for spread of alien species.

    <description>Aims: The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts how plant interactions change along environmental stress gradients. We tested the SGH in an aridity gradient, where support for the hypothesis and the specific shape of its response curve is controversial.Location: Almería, Cáceres and Coimbra, three sites in the Iberian Peninsula that encompass the most arid and wet habitats in the distribution range of a nurse shrub species –Retama sphaerocarpa L.

We estimated the frequency (changes in species richness), importance and intensity of the Retama effects, and derived the severity–interaction relationship pattern, analysing how these interaction indices changed along this aridity gradient.Results and conclusions: The intensity and frequency of facilitation by Retama increased monotonically with increasing environmental severity, and the importance tended to have a similar pattern, overall supporting the SGH. Our data did not support predictions from recent revisions of the SGH, which may not apply to whole plant communities like those studied here or when interactions are highly asymmetrical.

    <description>Question: What are the interactive roles of abiotic stress and plant interactions in mediating the zonation of the shrub Tamarix chinensis along a salinity gradient?Location: Yellow River estuary (37°46′N, 119°09′E), northeast China.Methods: We surveyed the zonation of T. chinensis along a salinity gradient and quantified its salt tolerance using a pot experiment. In two field experiments, we transplanted T. chinensis seedlings into salt marsh, transitional zone and upland habitats, manipulated neighbours and quantified survivorship and biomass to examine neighbour effects. We also quantified vegetation effects on abiotic conditions in each zone.Results: Tamarix chinensis dominated the transitional zone, but was absent in upland and salt marsh habitats. In the pot experiment, T. chinensis grew well in freshwater treatments, but was inhibited by increasing salinity. Field experiments revealed that competition from neighbours limited T. chinensis growth in the uplands, while T. chinensis transplants were limited, with or without neighbours, in the salt marsh by high soil salinity. In the transitional zone, however, T. chinensis transplants performed better with than without neighbours. Vegetation removal significantly elevated soil salinity in the transitional zone, but not in other zones.Conclusions: Competition, facilitation and abiotic stress are all important in mediating the zonation of T. chinensis.

    <description>Questions: What is the spectrum of variability of chemical elements in a Mediterranean forest ecosystem across the different compartments? Do co-existing tree species with different leaf chemical composition and nutrient cycling distinctly modify soil conditions? Could these species-specific, tree-generated soil changes create a potential positive feedback by affecting long-term species distribution?Location: Mixed oak forests of southern Spain, Los Alcornocales Natural Park.Methods: We sampled and chemically analysed five different ecosystem components: leaves, leaf fall, litter and superficial (0–25 cm) and sub-superficial (25–50 cm) soil beneath the canopies of evergreen Quercus suber and deciduous Q. canariensis trees. We used multiple co-inertia analysis (MCoA) to conjointly analyse the patterns of variability and covariation of eight macro- and micronutrients determined in each of the sampled ecological materials. We implemented a path analysis to investigate alternative causal models of relationships among the chemical properties of the different ecosystem components.Results: Variability in the concentration of chemical elements was related to the nature of their biogeochemical cycles.

    <description>Question: Biological soil crusts (BSCs) exist in arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide, and their recovery following the removal of a disturbance agent is integral to the rehabilitation of degraded landscapes. We asked: what is the likelihood of success and time frame of BSC recovery in vegetation remnants of southeast Australia, following livestock exclusion by fencing.Location: Dryland agricultural region of northwest Victoria, Australia.Methods: We conducted a “space for time” study of BSC recovery across 21 sites where livestock have been excluded by fencing between 1 and &gt;50 years ago, and used boosted regression tree models to explore the response of BSCs to livestock exclusion while controlling for the influence of environmental variables on BSC abundance.Results: Our results show a relatively rapid, passive recovery of BSCs following livestock exclusion, with cover stabilizing after 20 years. Sites heavily disturbed by livestock grazing at the time of fencing stabilized at a lower cover. In contrast to studies from other countries, our results suggest mosses, not cyanobacteria, are the important colonizers in our study region.Conclusions: Ecosystem function in degraded remnants of southern Australia can be improved in a relatively short time frame through passive recovery alone.

    <description>Questions: How are leaf attributes and relative growth rate (RGR) of the dominant tree species of tropical deciduous forest (TDF) affected by seasonal changes in soil moisture content (SMC)? What is the relationship of functional attributes with each other? Can leaf attributes singly or in combination predict the growth rate of tree species of TDF?Location: Sonebhadra district of Uttar Pradesh, India.Methods: Eight leaf attributes, specific leaf area (SLA); leaf carbon concentration (LCC); leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC); leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC); chlorophyll concentration (Chl), mass-based stomatal conductance (Gsmass); mass based photosynthetic rate (Amass); intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi); and relative growth rate (RGR), of six dominant tree species of a dry tropical forest on four sites were analysed for species, site and season effects over a 2-year period. Step-wise multiple regression was performed for predicting RGR from mean values of SMC and leaf attributes. Path analysis was used to determine which leaf attributes influence RGR directly and which indirectly.Results: Species differed significantly in terms of all leaf attributes and RGR. The response of species varied across sites and seasons. The attributes were positively interrelated, except for WUEi, which was negatively related to all other attributes. The positive correlation was strongest between Gsmass and Amass and the negative correlation was strongest between Gsmass and WUEi. Differences in RGR due to site were not significant when soil moisture was controlled, but differences due to season remained significant. The attributes showed plasticity across moisture gradients, which differed among attributes and species. Gsmass was the most plastic attribute.

In the step-wise multiple regression, Amass, SLA and Chl among leaf attributes and SMC among environmental factors influenced the RGR of tree species. Path analysis indicated the importance of SLA, LNC, Chl and Amass in determining RGR.Conclusion: Amass, SMC, SLA and Chl in combination can be used to predict RGR but could explain only three-quarters of the variability in RGR, indicating that other traits/factors, not studied here, are also important in modulating growth of tropical trees. RGR of tree species in the dry tropical environment is determined by soil moisture, whereas the response of mature trees of different species is modulated by alterations in key functional attributes such as SLA, LNC and Chl.</description>

    <description>Questions: How does plant diversity (species richness, species abundance and rate of change) evolve in early succession on bare peat? Does succession converge towards one equilibrium stage or end up in several stages? Is there a regular pattern in succession velocity?Location: A mire in the calcareous Jura Mountains of northwest Switzerland.Method: Twenty-one 1-m2 permanent plots on bare peat were used to monitor temporal stages over a 21-year period (1988 to 2008) in a Swiss mire where a slide occurred in 1987. Species diversity and life forms were analysed based on Shannon's equitability index and cover. We used classification and metric ordination techniques to investigate patterns of successional rates and trends. The high temporal resolution of the survey allowed the pattern of succession velocity to be analysed.Results: Species richness increased continuously over the 21 years of succession. The highest cover throughout the study period was the life form sedge. Time trajectories of the 21 plots revealed three alternative pathways towards intermediate equilibrium stages in the first years, still not converging in the later stages.
